## Objective of Phase 2 React Project:

### API Documentation: 
https://friends-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/quotes

## My Application: 
My React Single Page Application is a trivia game based on the Friends Television Series. Utilizing the quotes given in the API mentioned above, my application allows you to create a username, answer trivia questions, and keep track of your score. 

Through routing, you can click on `Home`, `About`, `Scores`, and `Comments`. 
* When clicking on `Home`, you can view the start of the trivia game and create your username.    
* When clicking `About`, you can see a brief description of the Friends TV show and a little bit about myself and why I chose Friends.   
* When clicking on `Scores`, you can view the last 10 scores organized by highest to lowest.   
* When clicking on `Comments`, you can make a comment about the game. 

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I can create a username and begin the trivia game. 
2. As a user, I can click left and right to flip through the trivia game questions and answer each with a timer of 10 seconds.
3. As a user, I can click on `Home`, `About`, `Scores`, and `Comments` to view the different features in each route.
