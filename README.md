# Phase Two React Project: Friends Trivia

My React Single Page Application is a trivia game based on the Friends Television Series. I created my own API JSON GitHub File to extract my data from. My application allows you to create a username, answer trivia questions, and keep track of your score. 

Via react-routing, you can click on `Home`, `About`, and `Trivia` 
* In `Home`, you can create your username and start the trivia.    
* In `About`, you can see a brief description of the Friends TV show and a little bit about myself and why I chose Friends.   
* In `Trivia`, you can go straight to the trivia game without logging a username.

## Objective of Phase 2 React Project:
* Build a Client-Side React Single Page Application.
* Use and persist data from an external API.
* Apply knowledge of components, props, and state.

## User Stories:
1. As a user, I can create a username and begin the trivia game. 
2. As a user, I can click through and answer the trivia game questions.
3. As a user, I can choose one of four answer options and check if the answer is correct and keep my score.
4. As a user, I can click on `Home`, `About`, `Trivia` to view the different features in each route.
