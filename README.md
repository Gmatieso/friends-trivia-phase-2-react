## Objective of Phase 2 React Project:

### API Documentation: 
https://csjeon28.github.io/Data/db.json

## My Application: 
My React Single Page Application is a trivia game based on the Friends Television Series. I created my own API JSON GitHub File to extract my data from. My application allows you to create a username, answer trivia questions, and keep track of your score. 

Through routing, you can click on `Home`, `About`, and `Trivia` 
* When clicking on `Home`, you can create your username and start the trivia.    
* When clicking `About`, you can see a brief description of the Friends TV show and a little bit about myself and why I chose Friends.   
* When clicking on `Trivia`, you can go straight to the trivia game without logging a username.   

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I can create a username and begin the trivia game. 
2. As a user, I can click through the trivia game questions.
3. As a user, I can choose one of four answer options and check if the answer is correct and keep my score.
4. As a user, I can click on `Home`, `About`, `Trivia` to view the different features in each route.
